Python Array API Standard: Toward Array Interoperability in the Scientific Python Ecosystem
===========================================================================================

.. class:: abstract

   The Python array API standard specifies standardized application programming
   interfaces (APIs) and behavior for array and tensor objects and operations
   as commonly found in libraries such as NumPy :cite:`Harris2020a`, PyTorch
   :cite:`Paszke2019a`, TensorFlow :cite:`Abadi2016a`, Dask :cite:`Rocklin2015a`,
   and CuPy :cite:`Okuta2017a`. The establishment and subsequent adoption of the
   standard aims to reduce ecosystem fragmentation and facilitate array library
   interoperability in user code and among array-consuming libraries, such as
   scikit-learn :cite:`Pedregosa2011a` and SciPy :cite:`Virtanen2020a`. A key
   benefit of array interoperability for downstream consumers of the standard is
   device agnosticism, whereby previously CPU-bound implementations can more
   readily leverage hardware acceleration via graphics processing units (GPUs),
   tensor processing units (TPUs), and other accelerator devices.

   In this paper, we first introduce the Consortium for Python Data API
   Standards and define the scope of the array API standard. We then discuss
   the current status of standardization and associated tooling (including a
   test suite and compatibility layer). We conclude by outlining plans for
   future work.

Introduction
============

Today, Python users have a wealth of choice for libraries and frameworks for
numerical computing :cite:`Millman2011a`:cite:`Harris2020a`:cite:`Virtanen2020a`:cite:`Okuta2017a`:cite:`Rocklin2015a`:cite:`Vanderwalt2014a`:cite:`Hoyer2017a`:cite:`Abbasi2018a`,
data science :cite:`Hunter2007a`:cite:`Perez2011a`:cite:`Seabold2010a`:cite:`Kluyver2016a`,
machine learning :cite:`Pedregosa2011a`, and deep learning :cite:`Chen2015a`:cite:`Paszke2019a`:cite:`Abadi2016a`:cite:`Frostig2018a`.
New frameworks pushing forward the state of the art appear every year. One
unintended consequence of all this activity has been fragmentation in the
fundamental building blocks—multidimensional arrays :cite:`Vanderwalt2011a`
(also known as tensors)—that underpin the scientific Python ecosystem (SPE).

This fragmentation comes with significant costs, from reinvention and
re-implementation of arrays and associated application programming interfaces
(APIs) to siloed technical stacks targeting only one array library to the
proliferation of user guides providing guidance on how to convert between, and
interoperate among, libraries. Too often, the APIs of each library are largely
similar, but each have enough differences that end users have to relearn and
rewrite code in order to work with multiple libraries. This process can be
very painful as the transition is far from seamless and creates barriers for
libraries wanting to support multiple array library backends.

The Consortium for Python Data API Standards (hereafter referred to as "the
Consortium" and "we") aims to address this problem by standardizing a
fundamental array data structure and an associated set of common APIs for
working with arrays, thus facilitating interchange and interoperability.

Paper Overview
==============

This paper is written as an introduction to the Consortium and the array API
standard. The aim is to provide a high-level overview of the standard and its
continued evolution and to solicit further engagement from the Python
community.

After providing an overview of the Consortium, we first discuss standardization
methodology. We then discuss the current status of the array API standard and
highlight the main standardization areas. Next, we introduce tooling
associated with the standard for testing compliance and shimming incompatible
array library behavior. We conclude by outlining open questions and
opportunities for further standardization. Links to the specification and all
current repository artifacts, including associated tooling, can be found in the
bibliography.

Consortium Overview
===================

History
-------

While the Python programming language was not designed for numerical computing,
the language gained initial popularity in the scientific and engineering
community soon after its release. The first array computing library for
numerical and scientific computing in Python was Numeric, developed in the mid-1990s :cite:`Dubois1996a`:cite:`Harris2020a`.
To better accommodate this library and its use cases, Python’s syntax was
extended to include indexing syntax :cite:`Hugunin1995a`.

In the early 2000s, a similar library, Numarray, introduced a more flexible
data structure :cite:`Greenfield2003a`. Numarray had faster operations for
large arrays, but slower operations for small arrays. Subsequently, both
Numeric and Numarray coexisted to satisfy different use cases.

In early 2005, the NumPy library unified Numeric and Numarray as a single
array package by porting Numarray’s features to Numeric :cite:`Harris2020a`. This
effort was largely successful and resolved the fragmentation at the time.
For roughly a decade, NumPy was the only widely used array library. Building on
NumPy, pandas was subsequently introduced in 2008 in order to address the need
for a high performance, flexible tool for performing quantitative analysis on
labeled tabular data :cite:`McKinney2011a`.

Over the past 10 years, the rise of deep learning and the emergence of new
hardware has led to a proliferation of new libraries and a corresponding
fragmentation within the PyData array and dataframe ecosystem. These libraries
often borrowed concepts from, or entirely copied, the APIs of older libraries,
such as NumPy, and then modified and evolved those APIs to address new needs
and use cases. While the communities of each library individually discussed
interchange and interoperability, no process for coordination among libraries
arose to avoid further fragmentation and to arrive at a common set of API
standards, until the founding of the Consortium.

The genesis for the Consortium grew out of many conversations among maintainers
during 2019-2020. During those conversations, it quickly became clear that any
attempt to create a new reference library to address fragmentation was
infeasible. Unlike in 2005, too many different use cases and varying
stakeholders now exist. Furthermore, the speed of innovation of both hardware
and software is simply too great.

In May 2020, an initial group of maintainers and industry stakeholders
assembled to form the Consortium for Python Data API Standards to begin
drafting specifications for array and dataframe APIs, which could then be
adopted by existing array and dataframe libraries and by any new libraries
which arise.

.. TODO: This feels like it cuts off. Should we say something about 2020-now?

Objectives
----------

Standardization efforts must maintain a delicate balance between codifying what
already exists and maintaining relevance with respect to future innovation. The
latter aspect is particularly fraught, as relevance requires anticipating
future needs, technological advances, and emerging use cases. Accordingly, if a
standard is to remain relevant, the standardization process must be
conservative in its scope, thorough in its consideration of current and prior
art, and have clearly defined objectives against which continued success is
measured.

To this end, we established four objectives for the array API standard. 1)
Increase interoperability such that array-consuming libraries can accept and
operate on any specification-conforming array library. 2) Reduce reinvention
and facilitate code sharing by establishing a common set of standardized APIs
and behavior. 3) Reduce barriers to array library creation by providing a set
of APIs which can be adopted as is. 4) Reduce the learning curve and friction
for users as they switch between array libraries.

We explicitly omitted three notable possible objectives. 1) Making array
libraries identical for the purpose of merging them. Different array libraries
have different strengths (e.g., performance characteristics, hardware support,
and tailored use cases, such as deep learning), and merging them into a single
array library is neither practical nor realistic. 2) Implementing a backend or
runtime switching system in order to switch from one array library to another
via a single setting or line of code. While potentially feasible, array
consumers are likely to need to modify code in order to ensure optimal
performance and behavior. 3) Support mixing multiple array libraries in
function calls. Mixing array libraries requires defining hierarchies and
specifying rules for device synchronization and data localization. Such rules
are likely to be specific to individual use cases.

Design Principles
-----------------

In order to define the contours of the standardization process, we established
the following design principles:

**Pure functions.** Functional API design is the dominant pattern among array
libraries, both in Python and in other frequently used programming languages
supporting array computation, such as MATLAB :cite:`Moler2020a` and Julia
:cite:`Bezanson2017a`. While method chaining and the fluent interface design
pattern are also relatively common, especially among array libraries supporting
deferred execution and operator fusion, functional APIs are generally preferred.
This mirrors design patterns used in underlying implementations, such as those
written in C/C++ and Fortran, and more closely matches written mathematical
notation.

**Minimal array object.** The standard should not require that an array object
have any attributes or methods beyond what is necessary for inspection (e.g.,
shape, data type, and device) or for supporting operator overloading (i.e.,
magic methods) [#]_.

**No dependencies.** The standard and its implementations should not require
any dependency outside of Python itself.

**Accelerator support.** Standardized APIs and behavior should be possible to
implement for both central processing units (CPUs) and hardware-accelerated
devices, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs),
and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

**Compiler support.** Standardized APIs and behavior should be amenable to
just-in-time (JIT) and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and graph-based
optimization techniques, such as those used by PyTorch :cite:`Paszke2019a`, JAX
:cite:`Bradbury2018a`, and TensorFlow :cite:`Abadi2016a`. APIs and behaviors
not amenable to compilation, such as APIs returning arrays having
data-dependent output shapes, should be specified as optional extensions.
Moreover, copy-view mutation semantics, such as those currently supported by
NumPy, should be considered an implementation detail and, thus, not suitable
for standardization.

**Distributed support.** Standardized APIs and behaviors should be amenable to
implementation in array libraries supporting distributed computing (e.g., Dask :cite:`Rocklin2015a`).

**Consistency.** Except in scenarios involving backward compatibility concerns,
naming conventions and design patterns should be consistent across
standardized APIs.

**Extensibility.** Conforming array libraries may implement functionality which
is not included in the array API standard. As a consequence, array consumers
should bear responsibility for ensuring that a given API is standardized and its
usage is portable across specification-conforming array libraries.

**Deference.** Where possible, the array API standard should defer to existing,
widely-used standards. For example, the accuracy and precision of numerical
functions should not be specified beyond the guidance included in IEEE 754 :cite:`IEEE754`.

**Universality.** Standardized APIs and behaviors should reflect common usage
among a wide range of existing array libraries. Accordingly, with rare
exception, only APIs and behaviors having existing implementations and broad
support within the SPE may be considered candidates for standardization.


Methods
=======

A foundational step in technical standardization is articulating a subset of
established practices and defining those practices in unambiguous terms. To
this end, the standardization process must approach the problem from two
directions: design and usage.

The former direction seeks to understand both current implementation design
(e.g., APIs, names, signatures, classes, and objects) and semantics (calling
conventions and behavior). The latter direction seeks to quantify API consumers
(e.g., who are the downstream users of a given API?), usage frequency (e.g.,
how often is an API consumed?), and consumption patterns (e.g., which optional
arguments are provided and in what context?). By analyzing both design and
usage, we sought to ground the standardization process and specification
decisions in empirical data and analysis.

Design
------

To understand API design of array libraries within the SPE, we first identified
a representative sample of commonly used Python array libraries. The sample
included the following libraries: NumPy, Dask Array, CuPy, MXNet, JAX,
TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Next, we extracted public APIs for each library by
analyzing module exports and scraping public web documentation. As an example
of extracted API data, consider the following APIs for computing the arithmetic
mean:

.. TODO (athan): line wrapping makes this block harder to grok, especially when inferring common kwargs; consider an alternative presentation

.. code:: python

   numpy.mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None,
       keepdims=<no value>)
   cupy.mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None,
       keepdims=False)
   dask.array.mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None,
       keepdims=False, split_every=None)
   jax.numpy.mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None,
       keepdims=False)
   mxnet.np.mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None,
       keepdims=False)
   tf.math.reduce_mean(input_tensor, axis=None,
       keepdims=False, name=None)
   torch.mean(input, dim, keepdim=False, out=None)

We determined commonalities and differences by analyzing the intersection, and
its complement, of available APIs across each array library. From the
intersection, we derived a subset of common APIs suitable for standardization
based on prevalence and ease of implementation. The common API subset included
function names, method names, attribute names, and positional and keyword
arguments. As an example of a derived API, consider the common API for
computing the arithmetic mean:

.. code:: python

   mean(a, axis=None, keepdims=False)

To assist in determining standardization prioritization, we leveraged usage
data (discussed below) to confirm API need and to inform naming conventions,
supported data types, and optional arguments. We have summarized findings and
published tooling :cite:`Consortium2022c` for additional analysis and
exploration, including Jupyter notebooks :cite:`Kluyver2016a`, as public
artifacts available on GitHub.

Usage
-----

To understand usage patterns of array libraries within the SPE, we first
identified a representative sample of commonly used Python libraries
("downstream libraries") which consume the sample of array libraries identified
during design analysis. The sample of downstream libraries included SciPy
:cite:`Virtanen2020a`, pandas :cite:`McKinney2011a`, Matplotlib
:cite:`Hunter2007a`, xarray :cite:`Hoyer2017a`, scikit-learn
:cite:`Pedregosa2011a`, and scikit-image :cite:`Vanderwalt2014a`, among others.
Next, we ran downstream library test suites with runtime instrumentation
enabled. We recorded input arguments and return values for each API invocation
by inspecting the bytecode stack at call time :cite:`Consortium2020a`. From the
recorded data, we generated empirical APIs based on provided arguments and
associated data types, noting which downstream library called which empirical
API and at what frequency. We then derived a single inferred API which unifies
the individual empirical API calling semantics. We organized the API results in
human-readable form as type definition files and compared the inferred API to
the publicly documented APIs obtained during design analysis.

The following is an example inferred API for `numpy.arange`, with the docstring
indicating the number of lines of code which invoked the function for each
downstream library when running downstream library test suites.

.. code:: python

   def arange(
     _0: object,
     /,
     *_args: object,
     dtype: Union[type, str, numpy.dtype, None] = ...,
     step: Union[int, float] = ...,
     stop: int = ...,
   ):
     """
     usage.dask: 347
     usage.matplotlib: 359
     usage.pandas: 894
     usage.sample-usage: 4
     usage.scipy: 1173
     usage.skimage: 174
     usage.sklearn: 373
     usage.xarray: 666
     ...
     """
     ...

As a final step, we ranked each API in the common API subset obtained during
design analysis according to relative usage using the Dowdall positional voting
system :cite:`Fraenkel2014a` (a variant of the Borda count :cite:`Emerson2013a`
that favors candidate APIs having high relative usage). From the rankings, we
assigned standardization priorities, with higher ranking APIs taking precedence
over lower ranking APIs, and extended the analysis to aggregated API categories
(e.g., array creation, manipulation, statistics, etc.). All source code, usage
data, and analysis are publicly available on GitHub :cite:`Consortium2020a`:cite:`Consortium2022c`.

.. TODO (athan): consider a figure showing the top 10 common API ranks (see Jupyter notebook for array API comparison).

   The array data structure and fundamental concepts. **a)** An array data
   structure and its associated metadata fields. **b)** Indexing an array.
   Indexing operations may access individual elements or sub-arrays. Applying
   a boolean mask is an optional indexing extension and may not be supported
   by all conforming libraries. **c)** Vectorization obviates the need for
   explicit looping in user code by applying operations to multiple array
   elements. **d)** Broadcasting enables efficient computation by implicitly
   expanding the dimensions of array operands to equal sizes. **e)** Reduction
   operations act along one or more axes. In the example, summation along a
   single axis produces a one-dimensional array, while summation along two
   axes produces a zero-dimensional array containing the sum of all array
   elements.

The Python array API standard specifies standardized APIs and behaviors for
array and tensor objects and operations. The scope of the standard includes
defining, but is not limited to, the following: 1) a minimal array object; 2)
semantics governing array interaction, including type promotion and
broadcasting; 3) an interchange protocol for converting array objects
originating from different array libraries; 4) a set of required array-aware
functions; and 5) optional extensions for specialized APIs and array
behaviors. We discuss each of these standardization areas in turn.

Array Object
------------

An array object is a data structure for efficiently storing and accessing
multidimensional arrays :cite:`Vanderwalt2011a`. Within the context of the
array API standard, the data structure is opaque—libraries may or may not grant
direct access to raw memory—and includes metadata for interpreting the
underlying data, notably "data type", "shape", and "device" (`Fig. 1a`_).

An array data type ("dtype") describes how to interpret a single array element
(e.g., integer, real- or complex-valued floating-point, boolean, or other). A
conforming array object has a single dtype. To facilitate interoperability,
conforming libraries must support and provide a minimal set of dtype
objects (e.g., `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `float32`, and `float64`). To ensure
portability, data type objects must be provided by name in the array library
namespace (e.g., `xp.bool`).

An array shape specifies the number of elements along each array axis (also
referred to as "dimension"). The number of axes corresponds to the
dimensionality (or "rank") of an array. For example, the shape `(10,)`
corresponds to a one-dimensional array containing 10 elements. The shape
`(3, 5)` corresponds to a two-dimensional array whose inner dimension contains
five elements and whose outer dimension contains three elements. The shape `()`
corresponds to a zero-dimensional array containing a single element.

An array device specifies the location of array memory allocation. A conforming
array object is assigned to a single logical device. To support array libraries
supporting execution on different device types (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, etc.),
conforming libraries must provide standardized device APIs in order to
coordinate execution location. The following example uses standardized
device APIs to ensure execution occurs on the same device as the input.

.. code:: python

   def some_function(x):
       # Retrieve a specification-compliant namespace
       xp = x.__array_namespace__()

       # Allocate a new array on the same device
       y = xp.linspace(0, 2*xp.pi, 100, device=x.device)

       # Perform computation
       return xp.sin(y) * x

To interact with array objects, one uses "indexing" to access sub-arrays and
individual elements, "operators" to perform logical and arithmetic operations
(e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `@`), and array-aware functions (e.g., for
linear algebra, statistical reductions, and element-wise computation). Array
indexing semantics extend built-in Python sequence `__getitem__()` indexing
semantics to support element access across multiple dimensions (`Fig. 1b`_).
Indexing an array using a boolean array (also known as "masking") is an
optional standardized extension. The result of a mask operation is
data-dependent and thus difficult to implement in array libraries relying on
static analysis for graph-based optimization.

Array Interaction
-----------------

The Python array API standard further specifies rules governing expected
behavior when an operation involves two or more array operands. For operations
in which the data type of a resulting array object is resolved from operand
data types, the resolved data type must follow type promotion semantics.
Importantly, type promotion semantics are independent of array shape or
contained values (including when an operand is a zero-dimensional array). For
example, when adding one array having a `float32` data type to another array
having a `float64` data type, the data type of the resulting array should be
the promoted data type `float64`.

.. code:: python

   >>> x1 = xp.ones((2, 2), dtype=xp.float32)
   >>> x2 = xp.ones((2, 2), dtype=xp.float64)
   >>> y = x1 + x2
   >>> y.dtype == xp.float64
   True

In addition to type promotion, the array API standard specifies rules governing
the automatic (and implicit) expansion of array dimensions to be of equal sizes
(`Fig. 1d`_). Broadcasting confers two important advantages. First, broadcasting
facilities user ergonomics by encouraging users to avoid unnecessary copying of
array data. Second, implicit expansion enables more efficient computation
through vectorization, reduced memory consumption, and cache locality.

Interchange Protocol
--------------------

We expect that array library consumers will generally prefer to use a single
array "type" (e.g., a NumPy `ndarray`, PyTorch `Tensor`, or Dask `array`) and
will thus need a standardized mechanism for array object conversion. For
example, suppose a data visualization library prefers to use NumPy internally
but would like to extend API support to any conforming array object type. In
such a scenario, the library would benefit from a reliable mechanism for
accessing and reinterpreting the memory of externally provided array objects
without triggering potential performance cliffs due to unnecessary copying of
array data. To this end, the Python array API standard specifies an interchange
protocol describing the memory layout of a strided, n-dimensional array in an
implementation-independent manner.

The basis of this protocol is DLPack, an open in-memory structure for sharing
tensors among frameworks :cite:`DLPack2023a`. DLPack is a standalone protocol
with an ABI stable, header-only C implementation with cross hardware support.
The array API standard builds on DLPack by specifying Python APIs for array
object data interchange :cite:`DLPack2023b`. Conforming array objects must
support `__dlpack__` and `__dlpack_device__` magic methods for accessing array
data and querying the array device. A standardized `from_dlpack()` API calls
these methods to construct a new array object of the desired type using
zero-copy semantics when possible. The combination of DLPack and standardized
Python APIs thus provides a stable, widely adopted, and efficient means for
array object interchange.

..    import torch

..    def some_function(x):
..        # Convert input arrays to PyTorch tensors:
..        if not isinstance(x, torch.Tensor):
..            x = torch.from_dlpack(x)

..        # Do stuff...

Array Functions
---------------

To complement the minimal array object, the Python array API standard specifies
a set of required array-aware functions for arithmetic, statistical, algebraic,
and general computation. Where applicable, required functions must support
vectorization (`Fig. 1d`_), which obviates the need for explicit looping in user
code by applying operations to multiple array elements. Vectorized abstractions
confer two primary benefits: 1) implementation-dependent optimizations leading
to increased performance and 2) concise expression of mathematical operations.
For example, one can express element-wise computation of *z*-scores in a single
line.

.. code:: python

    def z_score(x):
        return (x - xp.mean(x)) / xp.stdev(x)

In addition to vectorized operations, the array API standard includes, but is
not limited to, functions for creating new arrays, with support for explicit
device allocation, reshaping and manipulating existing arrays, performing
statistical reductions across one, multiple, or all array axes (`Fig. 1e`_), and
sorting array elements. Altogether, these APIs provide a robust and portable
foundation for higher-order array operations and general array computation.

Optional Extensions
-------------------

While a set of commonly used array-aware functions is sufficient for many
array computation use cases, additional, more specialized, functionality may be
warranted. For example, while most data visualization libraries are unlikely to
explicitly rely on APIs for computing Fourier transforms, signal analysis
libraries supporting spectral analysis of time series are likely to require
Fourier transform APIs. To accommodate specialized APIs, the Python array API
standard includes standardized optional extensions.

An extension is defined as a coherent set of standardized functionality which
is commonly implemented across many, but not all, array libraries. Due to
implementation difficulty (or impracticality), limited general applicability, a
desire to avoid significantly expanding API surface area beyond what is
essential, or some combination of the above, requiring conforming array
libraries to implement and maintain extended functionality beyond their target
domain is not desirable. Extensions provide a means for conforming array
libraries to opt-in to supporting standardized API subsets according to need
and target audience.

Specification Status
====================

Following formation of the Consortium in 2020, we released an initial draft of
the Python array API standard for community review in 2021. We have released
two subsequent revisions:

**v2021.12**: The first full release of the specification, detailing purpose
and scope, standardization methodology, future standard evolution, a minimal
array object, an interchange protocol, required data types, type promotion and
broadcasting semantics, an optional linear algebra extension, and array-aware
functions for array creation, manipulation, statistical reduction, and
vectorization, among others.

**v2022.12**: This revision included errata for the v2021.12 release and added
support for single- and double-precision complex floating-type data types,
additional array-aware APIs, an optional extension for computing fast Fourier
transforms.

For future revisions, we expect annual release cadences; however, array API
standard consumers should not assume a fixed release schedule.

Implementation Status
=====================

.. _numpy.array_api:

Reference Implementation
------------------------

To supplement the Python array API standard, we developed a standalone
reference implementation. The implementation is strictly compliant (i.e., any
non-portable usage triggers an exception) and is available as the
`numpy.array_api` submodule (discussed in :cite:`Gommers2021a`). In general,
we do not expect for users to rely on the reference implementation for
production use cases due to performance considerations. Instead, the reference
implementation is primarily useful as a means for testing whether array
library usage is guaranteed to be portable.

Ecosystem Adoption
------------------

Arrays are fundamental to scientific computing, data science, and machine
learning. As a consequence, the Python array API standard has many
stakeholders within the SPE. When establishing the Consortium, we thus sought
participation from a diverse and representative cross-section of industry
partners and maintainers of array and array-consuming libraries. In order to
satisfy stakeholder needs, array library maintainers worked in close
partnership with maintainers of array-consuming libraries throughout the array
API standardization process to identify key use cases and achieve consensus on
standardized APIs and behaviors.

Direct participation in the Consortium by array and array-consuming library
maintainers has facilitated coordination across the SPE. In addition to the
`numpy.array_api`_ reference implementation :cite:`Meurer2021a`, several
commonly used array libraries, including NumPy :cite:`berg2023a`, CuPy
:cite:`Fang2021a`, Dask :cite:`White2022a`, MXNet :cite:`Yyc2021a`, PyTorch
:cite:`Meier2021a`, and JAX :cite:`Vanderplas2023a`, have either adopted or
are in the process of adopting the array API standard. Increased array library
adoption has increased array interoperability, which, in turn, has encouraged
array-consuming libraries, such as SciPy :cite:`Yashchuk2022a` and
scikit-learn :cite:`Fan2022a`, to adopt the standard by decoupling their
implementations from specific array libraries. As array library adoption of
the standard matures, we expect ecosystem adoption to accelerate.

Tooling
=======

Test Suite
----------

To facilitate adoption of the Python array API standard by libraries within the
SPE, we developed a test suite to measure specification compliance
:cite:`Consortium2022b`. The test suite covers all major aspects of the
specification, such as broadcasting, type promotion, function signatures,
special case handling, and expected return values.

Underpinning the test suite is Hypothesis, a Python library for creating unit
tests :cite:`MacIver2019a`. Hypothesis uses property-based testing, a technique
for generating arbitrary data satisfying provided specifications and asserting
the truth of some "property" that should be true for each input-output pair.
Property-based testing is particularly convenient when authoring compliance
tests, as the technique enables the direct translation of specification
guidance into test code.

The test suite is the first example known to these authors of a full-featured,
standalone Python test suite capable of running against multiple different
libraries. As part of our work, we upstreamed strategies to Hypothesis for
generating arbitrary arrays from any conforming array library, thus allowing
downstream array consumers to test against multiple array libraries and their
associated hardware devices.

Compatibility Layer
-------------------

While we expect that maintainers of conforming array libraries will co-evolve
library APIs and behaviors with those specified in the Python array API
standard, we recognize that co-evolution is not likely to always proceed in
unison due to varying release cycles and competing priorities. Varying
timelines for adoption and full-compliance present obstacles for array-consuming
libraries, such as SciPy and scikit-learn, hoping to use the most recent
standardized behavior, as such libraries are effectively blocked by the slowest
array library release schedule.

To address this problem and facilitate adoption of the standard by
array-consuming libraries, we developed a compatibility layer (named
`array-api-compat`), which provides a thin wrapper around common array
libraries :cite:`Consortium2023a`. The layer transparently intercepts
API calls for any API which is not fully-compliant and polyfills non-compliant
specification-defined behavior. For compliant APIs, it exposes the APIs
directly, without interception, thus mitigating performance degradation risks
due to redirection. To reduce barriers to adoption, the layer supports vendoring
and has a small, pure Python codebase with no hard dependencies.

While the Python array API standard facilitates array interoperability in
theory, the compatibility layer does so in practice, helping array-consuming
libraries decouple adoption of the standard from the release cycles of upstream
array libraries. Currently, the layer provides shims for NumPy, CuPy, and
PyTorch and aims to support additional array libraries in the future. By
ensuring specification-compliant behavior, we expect the compatibility layer to
have a significant impact in accelerating adoption among array-consuming
libraries.

   Benchmarks measuring performance implications of adoption in array-consuming
   libraries. Displayed timings are relative to NumPy. All benchmarks were run
   on Intel i9-9900K and NVIDIA RTX 2080 hardware. **a)** Fitting a linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA) model. **b)** Predicting class labels using LDA.
   **c)** Estimating power spectral density using Welch's method and
   library-specific optimizations. **d)** Same as **c**, but using a strictly
   portable implementation. Note the change in limits along the vertical axis
   compared to **a-c**.

The principle aim of the Python array API standard is to facilitate
interoperability of array libraries within the SPE. In achieving this aim,
array-consuming libraries, such as those for statistical computing, data
science, and machine learning, can decouple their implementations from
specific array libraries. Decoupling subsequently allows end users to use the
array library that is most applicable to their use case and to no longer be
limited by the set of array libraries a particular array-consuming library
supports.

In addition to improved developer ergonomics afforded by standardized APIs and
increased interoperability, standardization allows end users and the authors of
array-consuming libraries to use a declarative, rather than imperative,
programming paradigm. This paradigm change has a key benefit in enabling users
to opt into performance improvements based on their constraints and hardware
capabilities. To assess the impact of this change, we worked with maintainers
of scikit-learn and SciPy to measure the performance implications of
specification adoption (`Fig. 2`_).

sckit-learn
-----------

scikit-learn is a machine learning library for use in Python. Its current
implementation relies heavily on NumPy and SciPy and is a mixture of Python and
Cython. Due to its dependence on NumPy for array computation, scikit-learn is
CPU-bound, and the library is unable to capture the benefits of GPU- and
TPU-based execution models. By adopting the Python array API standard,
scikit-learn can decouple its implementation from NumPy and support
non-CPU-based execution, potentially enabling increased performance.

To test this hypothesis, we first examined the scikit-learn codebase to
identify APIs which rely primarily on NumPy for their implementation.
scikit-learn estimators are one such set of APIs, having methods for model
fitting, classification prediction, and data projection, which are amenable to
input arrays supporting alternative execution models. Having identified
potential API candidates, we selected the estimator class for linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) as a representative test case. Refactoring the LDA
implementation was illustrative in several respects, as demonstrated in the
following code snippet showing source code modifications [#]_:

.. [#] Source code modifications reflect those required for NumPy version 1.24.3 and Python array API standard version 2022.12.

**Indexing:** *(lines 3-6)* NumPy supports indexing semantics which are not
supported in the array API standard. To be compliant with the standard, 1)
boolean masks must be the sole index and cannot be combined with other indexing
expressions, and 2) the number of provided single-axis indexing expressions
must equal the number of dimensions.

**Non-standardized APIs:** *(lines 8-9)* NumPy supports several APIs having no
equivalent in the array API standard; `np.dot()` is one such API. For
two-dimensional arrays, `np.dot()` is equivalent to matrix multiplication and
was updated accordingly.

**Naming conventions:** *(lines 11-12)* NumPy contains several standard-compliant
APIs whose naming conventions differ from those in the array API standard. In
this and similar cases, adoption requires conforming to the standardized
conventions.

**Functional APIs:** *(lines 14-15)* NumPy supports several array object methods
having no equivalent in the array API standard. To ensure portability, we
refactored use of non-standardized methods in terms of standardized functional
APIs.

**Scalars:** *(lines 18-22)* NumPy often supports non-array input arguments, such
as scalars, Python lists, and other objects, as "array-like" arguments in its
array-aware APIs. While the array API standard does not prohibit such
polymorphism, the standard does not require array-like support. In this case,
we explicitly convert a scalar expression to a zero-dimensional array in order
to ensure portability when calling `xp.sqrt()`.

**Data types:** *(lines 26-27)* NumPy often supports implicit type conversion of
non-numeric data types in numerical APIs. The array API standard does not
require such support, and, more generally, mixed-kind type promotion semantics
(e.g., boolean to integer, integer to floating-point, etc.) are not specified.
To ensure portability, we must explicitly convert a boolean array to an integer
array before calling `xp.sum()`.

To test the performance implications of refactoring scikit-learn's LDA
implementation, we first generated a random two-class classification problem
having 400,000 samples and 300 features. We next devised two benchmarks, one
for fitting an LDA model and a second for predicting class labels for each
simulated sample. We then ran the benchmarks and measured execution time for
NumPy, PyTorch, and CuPy backends on Intel i9-9900K and NVIDIA RTX 2080
hardware. For PyTorch, we collected timings for both CPU and GPU execution
models. To ensure timing reproducibility and reduce timing noise, we repeated
each benchmark ten times and computed the average execution time.

`Fig. 2a`_ and `Fig. 2b`_ display results, showing average execution time
relative to NumPy. When fitting an LDA model (`Fig. 2a`_), we observe 1.9x
higher throughput for PyTorch CPU, 7.9x for CuPy, and 45.1x for PyTorch GPU.
When predicting class labels (`Fig. 2b`_), we observe 2.5x higher throughput
for PyTorch CPU, 24.6x for CuPy, and 44.9x for PyTorch GPU. In both benchmarks,
using GPU execution models corresponded to significantly increased performance,
thus supporting our hypothesis that scikit-learn can benefit from non-CPU-based
execution models, as afforded by array API standard adoption.

SciPy
-----

SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions for
numerical integration, optimization, interpolation, statistics, linear algebra,
signal processing, and image processing, among others. Similar to scikit-learn,
its current implementation relies heavily on NumPy. We thus sought to test
whether SciPy could benefit from adopting the Python array API standard.

Following a similar approach to the sckit-learn benchmarks, we identified
SciPy's signal processing APIs as being amenable to input arrays supporting
alternative execution models and selected an API for estimating the power
spectral density using Welch's method :cite:`Welch1967a` as a representative
test case. We then generated a synthetic test signal having 50,000,000 data
points. We next devised two benchmarks, one using library-specific
optimizations and a second strictly using APIs in the array API standard. We
ran the benchmarks for the same backends, on the same hardware, and using the
same analysis approach as the scikit-learn benchmarks discussed above.

`Fig. 2c`_ and `Fig. 2d`_ display results, showing average execution time
relative to NumPy. When using library-specific optimizations (`Fig. 2c`_), we
observe 1.4x higher throughput for PyTorch CPU, 51.5x for CuPy, and 78.5x for
PyTorch GPU. When omitting library-specific optimizations (`Fig. 2d`_), we
observe a 12-25x **decreased** throughput across all non-NumPy backends.

The source of the performance disparity is due to use of strided views in the
optimized implementation. NumPy, CuPy, and PyTorch support the concept of
strides, where a stride describes the number of bytes to move forward in memory
to progress to the next position along an axis, and provide similar,
non-standardized APIs for manipulating the internal data structure of an array.
While one can use standardized APIs to achieve the same result, using stride
"tricks" enables increased performance. This finding raises an important point.
Namely, while the Python array API standard aims to reduce the need for
library-specific code, it will never fully eliminate that need. Users of the
standard may need to maintain similar library-specific performance
optimizations to achieve maximal performance. We expect, however, that the
maintenance burden should only apply for those scenarios in which the
performance benefits significantly outweigh the maintenance costs.

Future Work
===========

*TODO (athan): rework based on open questions; also include tooling for tracking adoption (compatibility tables, test suite reporting, etc); Parallelization? Context manager? Device standardization? String dtypes? Support mixing array libraries? IO? stuff out of scope, but people need (e.g., SciPy dist)?*



Work is underway on an array API compliance website. (*TODO (athan): compliance monitoring*)

Similar effort underway under the Data APIs Consortium umbrella to
standardize a library author-focused API for Python dataframe libraries. This
work will be discussed in a future paper.

Conclusion
==========

The Python array API standard specifies standardized APIs and behaviors for
array and tensor objects and operations.

*TODO (athan): implications for broader ecosystem. Importance/significance of work. Future benefits.*
